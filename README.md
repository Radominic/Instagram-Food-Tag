<hr/>

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
WAMP
MySQL
Python
Tool for using Php (notepad, visual studio,…)
<hr/>
## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
### Break down into end to end tests
First, execute crawler.py and datastore.py. Then make database ‘Instagram’. Also, make table named ‘tag’ and column ‘id, name, heart’.
Then, go to the website we created.
Ex.www.fooddetector.com
You can first check sources for the Instagram data from the map.
Then input the word you want to search like food or province.
Then you’ll get result of frequency of tag, and the number of likes from the word you searched.
We showed two tables for the frequency and likes from the word we searched.

From the info page, you can get our team information and brief explanation of our project.
## Deployment
Since our project for data gathering, and refinement is automated, we can make live system.
If we use other sources rather than Instagram, we could get better output.
